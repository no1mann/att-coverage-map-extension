# AT&T Coverage Map Chrome Extension
Enable's mmWave coverage on the offical AT&amp;T Coverage Map

# Background
Verizon has been the only carrier to show mmWave coverage on their coverage map. After looking at the code for AT&T's Coverage Map, I found out that AT&T has mmWave data, but they are forceably hiding it. This extension enables that mmWave coverage and displays it on their coverage map.

# Disclaimer
All mmWave data comes directly from AT&T. I can not speak for the validity of the coverage and I'm unaware of the last time they updated it.
